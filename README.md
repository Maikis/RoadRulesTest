# RoadRulesTest
Small road rules test, which uses mysql database

This is my attempt to start building some small Lithuanian road rules test program. 

I am doing this for my own practise and to get more experience in Java programming.

MainClass.java:
This is the main program file with main() method. It takes care of GUI.

DBHandler.java:
Communicates with mySQL database, fetches questions, randomly generates new tests.
